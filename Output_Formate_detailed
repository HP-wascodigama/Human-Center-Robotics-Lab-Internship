JSON Output Format

There are 2 alternatives to save the OpenPose output. But both of them follow the keypoint ordering described in the the section Keypoint Ordering in C++/Python section (which you should read next).

    The --write_json flag saves the people pose data onto JSON files. Each file represents a frame, it has a people array of objects, where each object has:
        pose_keypoints_2d: Body part locations (x, y) and detection confidence (c) formatted as x0,y0,c0,x1,y1,c1,.... The coordinates x and y can be normalized to the range [0,1], [-1,1], [0, source size], [0, output size], etc. (see the flag --keypoint_scale for more information), while the confidence score (c) in the range [0,1].
        face_keypoints_2d, hand_left_keypoints_2d, and hand_right_keypoints_2d are analogous to pose_keypoints_2d but applied to the face and hand parts.
        body_keypoints_3d, face_keypoints_3d, hand_left_keypoints_2d, and hand_right_keypoints_2d are analogous but applied to the 3-D parts. They are empty if --3d is not enabled. Their format is x0,y0,z0,c0,x1,y1,z1,c1,..., where c is 1 or 0 depending on whether the 3-D reconstruction was successful or not.
        part_candidates (optional and advanced): The body part candidates before being assembled into people. Empty if --part_candidates is not enabled (see that flag for more details).
